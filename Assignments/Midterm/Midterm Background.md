# Midterm Project Background - Police Militarization and Lethal Force
## Sunil Narayan

When reading the details for this project, one of the first societal problems to jump into my head was continued police militarization and the negative effects it may be having on our communities. 

Over the past year, one dramatic event which stands out is the outpouring of support for the Black Lives Matter movement and its calls to "defund the police." In specific, one possible problem with police funding is the increased militarization of the american police force. Militarization is the process of moving towards a more militaristic state, through programs such as the [1033 program](https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA609611.pdf) of the National Defense Authorization Act, which allows the Department of Defence to transfer military weapons to local police forces to deter drug crime. 

Arguments for and against militarization are varied. Proponents claim that it is the natural response to the escalating danger of drug-related crime, slows down crime, and keeps officers safe. Arguments against the militarization include the idea that officers dressed in combat gear leads to unrest in otherwise stable situations, and the claim that having access to such hardware makes police over-aggressive, resulting in unnecessary uses of lethal force ([see Steidley et al., sections 2 and 3 for more info](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/soc4.12674?casa_token=hGOq_J7fQ4oAAAAA%3Anl9UFTAEvia63GFo4IsszioZnr1ZxT65Q-BKvspyBYDGinAdON5PPk3wNG46syOK0xzU2D_4COd1Bo6h)). This has led to those who are cynical of police forces to [point to militarization as problem](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0011128718770689?casa_token=lCpAMYd_XGAAAAAA%3A-fEebmBACaGZk6oNqc6vE-Mezj-d7p_rKRpR39jui-7eC1UPZDDSb4KbQ0KBxY-Acoz9nWjJuCbl1w). Reforming such a problem or proving that it isn't a problem in the first place could be beneficial to relations between the police and the public. In this analysis, I will specifically focus on the ideas that increased militarization leads to decreased violent crime, and the counterargument that it causes unnecessary casualties.  

Other analyses ([for example, Delehanty et al.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/2053168017712885)) have confirmed a link between police militarization and violence in single states. I want to do a national analysis of the outcomes of police militarization composed of 3 parts: 

1. The rate of lethal force employed by US police forces over time
2. The change over time in the rate of crime
3. The militarization of american police forces

The idea here is to see if the policy of police adopting military hardware is an effective means of maintaining a safe and just society. The primary metrics used are the number of violent crimes committed, the number of incidents of lethal force, and the dollar value of the military hardware transferred to state police departments. The reason to study violent crimes is that it seems more probable that arming the police will impact violent crime instead of nonviolent crime, because there should be no need for police to employ military equipment against a nonviolent target. The reason to study incidents of lethal force instead of all police violence is the severity of lethal force. The difference between killing someone and injuring them is that death is permanent and irreversible whereas other impacts are likely impermanent, and thus lower stakes. The reason to study the dollar value of the military hardware transferred is that the more military equipment a police department acquires, the more militarized it becomes.  The analysis will take place on data from the years 2000-2014, because those are the years for which data regarding all 3 metrics is readily available. This will also take place on a national level as opposed to a state-by-state breakdown. This is because I am not looking to compare different states against each other, but am exclusively looking at the variables identified above and how they change over time. Using all the states together will hopefully improve the precision relative to any individual state due to having vastly more total data points.  

The research questions are the following:

1. How has the use of lethal force by the police changed over time?
2. How has the crime rate changed over time?
3. Has the increase in funding for military weapons and training correlated with a change in either of these trends?

I believe that these questions are important because they allow us to better understand the forces which shape our country, and gaining insight into this issue may better help us design future policies. 

The ethical concerns relating to this problem are considerable. First, this is a situation with life-or-death consequences, and one in which there are a large number of variables which are constantly changing. Even if I were able to maximize the utility of the few data sets which I can find, it would only provide some context into the problem, and would not be enough to make any sweeping generalizations as to solutions to the complicated issue of police violence. Secondly, it is very hard to quantify "police militarization", which is more of a sociological term than a scientific one. Due to the difficulty of making sociological generalizations, I will need to be very careful in order to not pretend like this has definitive answers about the justice system one way or another. This analysis will be exclusively for generating an idea of whether or not there is a glaring statistical correlation between militarization, crime, and civilian deaths, and is not in depth enough to make any more nuanced point about such a complex system.

The societal impacts of this problem are sweeping. Inaccurately assessing the threat posed by militarized police forces or the benefit reaped by the same could lead to a needless increase and civilian deaths when interacting with the police, or alternatively could lead to reversing a trend in decreasing crime. This is further stressed by the politically charged nature of this situation, as police forces nationwide want to show that their operation does not cause unnecessary harm and activists for police reform want to show that this program is a major cause of needless violence. Inaccurate information could also have a ripple effect throughout the rest of American society, as failing to reform the problems associated with police violence could inflame the already fraught tensions between certain police forces and the people who they pledged to protect.
